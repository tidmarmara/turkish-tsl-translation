# Turkish to Turkish Sign Language (TSL) Translation
This repository provides several translation models that is used for translating Turkish texts to TSL equivalents. Neural Machine Translation (NMT) methods used to achieve this. There are several networks used in the project:
* Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based architectures
  * LSTM
  * GRU
  * BLSTM
  * BGRU
* Transformers

The results obtained from this project are gathered in <this-paper>.
